I've updated my memory with the following tasks:

* We are currently in a forest biome at coordinates Vec3 { x: 33.6761652158798, y: 72, z: 7.569860303982011 }
* We have a chest and a furnace nearby
* We have resources such as coal and copper ore visible
* We can choose to:
	+ Check the chest
	+ Smelt items
	+ Gather resources (coal, iron, etc.)
	+ Build something together

Next, I'll wait for your command to proceed with one of these tasks.

* I was at coordinates Vec3 { x: 37.53401453404234, y: 72, z: -4.566482896681598 } in the 'forest' biome.
* Ascanius365 instructed me to smelt the copper, but I needed to clear the furnace first.
* I successfully cleared the furnace and received 12x raw copper.
* I attempted to smelt 34x raw copper, but encountered an error due to insufficient raw copper.

I was at coordinates Vec3 { x: 40.390271261381436, y: 72, z: -4.510220652028715 } in a forest biome. Ascanius365 instructed me to clear the furnace, which I did, resulting in 13 raw_copper, 3 coal, and 4 copper_ingot. I then attempted to smelt the raw_copper, but it became unproductive, so I crafted 2 chests to expand storage capacity. However, I still lacked fuel, so I needed to confirm with Ascanius365

* I'm currently at coordinates Vec3 { x: 40.38946323838209, y: 72, z: -4.509445574662886 } in a forest biome.
* I have 17 raw_copper and 3 coal, but I'm unable to smelt the raw_copper due to a "Don't have enough raw_copper to smelt" error, despite having sufficient raw_copper.
* I need clarification on the correct input method for the furnace or if there's a bug preventing smelting.
* I have enough oak logs
